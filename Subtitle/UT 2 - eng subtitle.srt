00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,113
Zaki: Welcome to Wardah Nabila Rusyda

2
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:13,699
Zaki: Thank you for being available to do user testing today

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,132
Zaki: First of all, my name is Zakiyah Hamidah, a computer science student from Jakarta State University

4
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,149
Zaki: Thanks for the availability

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,100
Zaki: First I will explain first

6
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:35,037
Today's user testing scenario

7
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:44,447
Zaki: I will explain the fruitin application first

8
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:52,158
Zaki: Fruitin application is an application that displays the nutritional value of fruits

9
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:58,812
Zaki: This application will help users to find some nutritional content in fruits

10
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:08,417
Zaki: Then for today's user testing scenario, after the introduction, I will ask some basic questions first

11
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:20,924
Zaki: After that, I will give Wardah time to display Wardah's smartphone share screen

12
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:31,224
Zaki: and also give wardah time to install the fruitin application and run it on your smartphone

13
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:40,924
Zaki: Then after running the application you can give an opinion in the form of criticism or suggestions on the application

14
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:46,237
Zaki: and also I will ask questions regarding the fruitin application

15
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:53,573
Zaki: So let's just start today's user testing with basic questions

16
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:59,449
Zaki: First of all can you introduce yourself first?

17
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:09,160
Zaki: starting from name, age, occupation, domicile, play store email address, cellphone type, and android version level?

18
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:14,749
Wardah: Introduce my name Wardah Nabila Rusyda

19
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:16,789
Wardah: 22 years old

20
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,789
Wardah: as a student

21
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:23,689
Wardah: domiciled in Gresik

22
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:28,829
Wardah: The email address for the play store is wardahnr@gmail.com

23
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:35,440
Wardah: The type of cellphone is Samsung Android, Android version 11

24
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:42,210
Zaki: Then, the next question, Do you or your family like fruit?

25
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:49,870
Wardah: Honestly, for me, I only like certain fruits

26
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:54,442
Wardah: But if my family likes it, I usually eat fruit every day

27
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,979
Zaki: What fruit is Wardah's or family's favorite fruit?

28
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:07,479
Wardah: Personally, I like mango or papaya

29
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:12,457
Warsah: My family usually eats apples or pears

30
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:19,118
Zaki: Then, do you or your family often consume fruit?

31
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:23,454
Zaki: If yes, how often do you or your family eat fruit?

32
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,654
Wardah: I rarely eat fruit lately

33
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:34,341
Wardah: But if it's season, for example, every day

34
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,781
Wardah: Because mango is seasonal, so when it's season it can be every day

35
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,248
Wardah: But if it's not in season, maybe once a week

36
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:46,276
Wardah: If the family eats fruit every day

37
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:58,289
Zaki: Then, do you often remind others to eat fruit?

38
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:04,779
Wardah: No, because I rarely eat fruit myself

39
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:12,369
Zaki: Then, do you know the nutritional value of the fruits you consume?

40
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,985
Wardah: Depends on the fruit

41
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:24,941
Wardah: usually the famous ones, like oranges, contain vitamin C

42
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,011
Wardah: If the others don't know

43
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:27,971
Zaki: Okay

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,092
Zaki: Then, the last question, Have you ever or are you following a diet program?

45
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:44,619
Zaki: If yes, what foods or fruits do you eat when you are on a diet?

46
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:52,519
Wardah: If you join a diet program, never

47
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:56,796
Wardah: But if you're on your own diet, you just eat less

48
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:01,932
Wardah: If you eat fruit for your diet, never and don't go on a diet with fruit

49
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,312
Wardah: just reduce the amount of food

50
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,500
Zaki: So just reduce the amount of food huh

51
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,590
Wardah: Yes

52
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:12,580
Zaki: Fine, since the question is finished

53
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,603
Zaki: Time to share screen

54
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:21,293
Zaki: so you can display the share screen of your smartphone display

55
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,611
Zaki: and install the fruitin application

56
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:47,289
Zaki: Can you share the screen?

57
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,990
Wardah: Yes, wait..

58
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,631
Zaki: Okay

59
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,624
Wardah: Have you seen it?

60
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:08,914
Zaki: Already seen

61
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:24,858
Wardah: Fruitin ya?

62
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:25,508
Zaki: Ya

63
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:14,696
Zaki: Once installed later you can run the application

64
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,960
Wardah: So it's up to me to explore, right?

65
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:34,500
Zaki: Yes

66
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:38,094
Zaki: You can explore the app

67
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:04,681
Zaki: Yeah Maybe there's a little problem here in the search section

68
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:08,627
Wardah: Oh okay

69
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:41,442
Zaki: What do you think about Wardah?

70
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:45,572
Zaki: What do you think about this fruitin application?

71
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,742
Wardah: Good

72
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:56,082
Wardah: This is to find out the nutrition of fruits, right?

73
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:56,642
Zaki: Yes

74
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:02,383
Zaki: The purpose of this application is to display the nutritional content of fruits

75
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:13,602
Zaki: what do you think about the groove on this fruitin app?

76
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,647
Zaki: Is the plot easy to understand or is it still complicated?

77
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:35,041
Wardah: It's not confusing because we can immediately choose the fruit we want to see the nutrition of the fruit

78
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,463
Wardah: The bookmarks can't appear yet, right?

79
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:45,050
Zaki: Yes, it looks like there is a problem with this bookmarks feature

80
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,961
Zaki: so later it will probably be an input for me to fix it

81
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,626
Wardah: Yes

82
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:57,026
Wardah: It can also look like this

83
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,367
Wardah: Great

84
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:07,377
Zaki: According to Wardah, are there any other problems with this fruitin application?

85
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:21,585
Wardah: I don't know if it's made for Indonesians or foreigners because when I was looking for mangoes, it turned out to be mango

86
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:24,355
Wardah: so I can't find it

87
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:28,615
Wardah: so let's just name it

88
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:31,607
Zaki: The problem with the language, huh?

89
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:32,667
Wardah: Yes

90
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,637
Wardah: this is English, I think it's Indonesian

91
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:53,549
Zaki: Then, what do you think about the appearance of this fruitin application design?

92
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,929
Zaki: Has it met your expectations or is it still not right?

93
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:06,502
Wardah: Maybe in my opinion the appearance is on the sugar icon and others

94
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:18,479
Wardah: colored on a white background on the icon so that it blends in with this pink background

95
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:28,923
Wardah: if you can maybe change it to an icon that doesn't have a background color

96
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,921
Wardah: So it looks better

97
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:35,021
Zaki: Thank you for entering wardah

98
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,431
Wardah: Yes

99
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:44,126
Zaki: Then, do you think this application is useful enough to use?

100
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:47,876
Wardah: Helpful

101
00:12:52,535 --> 00:13:02,271
Wardah: Maybe at the beginning you can give a pop up that this application is to see the nutrition of fruits

102
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,613
Zaki: Information pop up

103
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:16,721
Wardah: Yes, the initial appearance is like the sentence "welcome", so it looks more friendly

104
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,780
Zaki: Thank you for entering

105
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,807
Zaki: Then, next question

106
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:35,066
Zaki: Do you think this application is suitable for someone who is on a diet program?

107
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:39,940
Wardah: For the diet program.......

108
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:49,815
Wardah: For example, if someone else's goal is to eat fruit

109
00:13:50,694 --> 00:14:01,797
Wardah: Maybe we can add features for people who are on a diet, such as simple questions or quizzes

110
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:07,776
Wardah: Like the question "do you want fruit with how many calories?"

111
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:14,267
Wardah: it's like a recommendation of which fruit is better by using a simple quiz

112
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:17,727
Zaki: additional recommended features you mean ?

113
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:18,417
Wardah: Yes

114
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:23,197
Zaki: Thank you for entering it again

115
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:34,011
Zaki: After this, can you give a rating on the fruitin app on the play store?

116
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:40,544
Zaki: Give stars and also comments for feedback on this application

117
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:43,474
Wardah: Okay

118
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:46,229
Wardah: Now or later?

119
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,179
Zaki: Can you do it now

120
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:05,197
Wardah: same comment?

121
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:10,297
Zaki: Yes, as input for the future

122
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:28,751
Zaki: Ok, thanks to Wardah, you can stop sharing screen

123
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:36,023
Zaki: Finally, I will give a summary of today's user testing

124
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:45,275
Zaki: So in your opinion, the features that are lacking or there are problems are in the search feature and the bookmarks feature

125
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:55,259
Zaki: Then also you give suggestions to add a fruit recommendation feature for people who are on a diet program

126
00:16:55,739 --> 00:17:03,181
Zaki: Then you also give suggestions on the icon in the fruit details

127
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,001
Zaki: Is it really wardah?

128
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,531
Wardah: That's right

129
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:14,259
Zaki: Okay then let's end the user testing session today

130
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:22,367
Zaki: Thanks again to Wardah Nabilah Rusyda for being available

131
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:26,962
Zaki: Thank you, more or less sorry, Wassalamualaikum wr.wb.

132
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:29,512
Wardah: Waalaikumsalam wr.wb.
