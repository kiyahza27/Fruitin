Zaki: and ask you to download fruitin app from play store

10
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:16,494

11
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,399
Zaki: and also give you a question regarding the fruitin application

12
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:23,328

Zaki: Okay fine

23
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:25,613
Zaki: Next question, Do you or your family like fruit? and can you give the reason?

24
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:31,073
Latifa: I like it, because my family and I really like fruit

25
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:36,313
Latifa: Every day or every week there is fruit consumption

26
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:40,873
Latifa: because fruit is complementary and for health too

27
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:43,003
Zaki: Okay

28
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:49,684
Zaki: Then, do you often eat fruit? if so, how often do you or your family eat fruit?

29
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,094
Latifa: Personally it's rare

30
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:58,492
Latifa: But my family eats fruit almost every week

31
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:05,002
Zaki: What fruit do you or your family eat often?

32
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:15,948
Latifa: at home it's usually papaya, avocado, watermelon

33
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:23,180
Zaki: Then, do you often remind others to consume fruits?

34
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,009
Latifa: Often eats fruit

35
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:30,983
Zaki: Okay

36
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:36,436
Zaki: Then, do you know the nutritional value of these fruits?

37
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,353
Latifa: I know

38
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:45,143
Latifa: For the nutritional value of fruits, they are good for health too

39
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:50,353
Latifa: Then also as a vitamin supplement

40
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:53,793
Latifa: like vitamin C or vitamin B or something else

41
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:54,803
Zaki: Okay

42
00:03:55,542 --> 00:04:00,656
Zaki: Then, lastly, have you ever followed a diet program?

43
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:05,694
Zaki: If yes, what foods or fruits do you eat when you are on a diet?

44
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:10,173
Latifa: For now I never go on a diet

45
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:11,743
Zaki: Okay, fine

46
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:15,892
Zaki: Okay, since the question is done

47
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,110
Zaki: it's your time to share screen

48
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,112
Zaki: So, you can share your smartphone display screen

49
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:34,469
Zaki: You can run some features on the fruitin app

50
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:40,546
Zaki: You can also give your opinion, either criticism or suggestions on the application

51
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:00,495
Latifa: Regarding the app

52
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,915
Latifa: It's been good

53
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:11,939
Latifa: However, maybe you can add more to the list of fruits

54
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:13,489
Latifa: Added more

55
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:21,089
Latifa: Then I was also looking for apples in the search, it doesn't seem to show up

56
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:25,212
Latifa: And for the others it's okay

57
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:33,698
Zaki: You can open or try other application features on the fruit list

58
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:34,938
Latifa: Is this it?

59
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:35,488
Zaki: yes

60
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:40,037
Latifa: Already

61
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:45,791
Zaki: Then you can go back, and you can try to open the bookmarks menu

62
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:50,231
Zaki: Does the feature work well or not

63
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,561
Zaki: What do you think?

64
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,391
Latifa: It's been good

65
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:07,734
Latifa: Here is also every fruit, given an explanation regarding the fruit itself

66
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:14,334
Latifa: So we know better the nutritional content of these fruits

67
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,576
Latifa: Is it good to eat or not

68
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:20,446
Latifa: Moreover, there are those who are running a diet program

69
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:25,639
Latifa: For Information it's good enough

70
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:32,399
Latifa: Maybe the only drawback is when I want to look for fruit, nothing shows up

71
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:53,052
Zaki: Then, do you think this application needs additional features?

72
00:07:54,752 --> 00:08:03,863
Latifa: An additional feature may be the previous one, namely the addition of the list of fruits to be even more

73
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:08,253
Latifa: because I personally think that's enough

74
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:12,981
Latifa: But surely according to other people want to see more

75
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,420
Latifa: Want to find out information related to what the content of the fruit looks like

76
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,540
Latifa: Then also can be favorite

77
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:36,416
Latifa: if possible there is a favorite feature, so that users can add their favorite fruit to find information related to the nutritional content of the fruit

78
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:57,165
Zaki: Alright, I'll ask you a few more questions

79
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:03,323
Zaki: In your opinion, does this application meet your expectations?

80
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:06,623
Latifa: It's appropriate

81
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:09,163
Latifa: It's been really good

82
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,826
Zaki: Then,....

83
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:19,103
Zaki: The search feature in your opinion should be improved

84
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:21,253
Latifa: Iya

85
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:24,523
Zaki: And also increase the fruit list

86
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:29,603
Zaki: Apart from that, are there any other criticisms or suggestions regarding this application?

87
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:34,276
Latifa: Maybe add a user profile

88
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:49,674
Zaki: For the appearance of the application itself, can you give an opinion about the design of this application display?

89
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:56,695
Latifa: In my opinion the design is good, simple, and to the point with what we want to look for

90
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,382
Latifa: It's obvious

91
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:03,052
Latifa: no need to bother anymore to look for it

92
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:08,942
Zaki: So, do you think that the design of this application is in line with expectations?

93
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:12,926
Latifa: Yes, it's very much in line with expectations

94
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:22,107
Latifa: Then, do you think this application is useful enough to use?

95
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:27,547
Latifa: Very useful, moreover it's good for health too

96
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:32,075
Latifa: So whatever we eat we can see the content

97
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:40,435
Latifa: if it's good for our bodies, it will definitely be very useful information from this fruitin application

98
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:50,491
Zaki: Then in your opinion, is this application suitable for someone who is on a diet program?

99
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:53,241
Latifa: It fits perfectly

100
00:10:54,051 --> 00:11:01,168
Latifa: It fits very well, so we can know what fruit we will eat each day

101
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:05,961
Latifa: So let's not continue to eat the fruit

102
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,091
Latifa: So it's been very good and helps people who are going on a diet program

103
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,841
Zaki: okay that's it, you can just close the app

104
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,461
Latifa: Good

105
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:45,188
Zaki: First, I want to ask a few more questions regarding this fruitin application

106
00:11:50,487 --> 00:12:03,496
Zaki: In your opinion, is there anything that needs to be changed or added to this application?

107
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:22,726
Latifa: Maybe, just a little extra so that the icons of the fruits are minimized

108
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:28,368
Latifa: There were 2 columns, they can be reduced so that we can know more at a glance

109
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,845
Zaki: Described more?

110
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:34,605
Latifa: Iya

111
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:48,006
Zaki: Oh yeah, can you please rate the app and leave a comment on this app

112
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:50,606
Zaki: Can you share the screen one more time?

113
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:01,639
Latifa: wait, share screen again?

114
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:02,290
Zaki: Yes

115
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:10,195
Zaki: Then you can rate or comment on the app in the play store

116
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:11,625
Latifa: In the play store, right?

117
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,473
Latifa: Would you give a star?

118
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:18,923
Zaki: Yes, it is appropriate to rate this fruitin application

119
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:43,072
Latifa: Done

120
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:48,021
Zaki: Thank you to Latifa for her assessment

121
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,341

122
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,176

125
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:11,858
Zaki: Thank you for the time and opportunity

126
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:16,533
Zaki: More or less sorry, wassalamualikum wr.wb

127
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,033

128
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,533
Zaki: Thanks to Latifa
