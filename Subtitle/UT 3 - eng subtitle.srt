00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:13,337
Zaki: Welcome to Cindi Tri Fitikasari

2
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:24,797
Zaki: Thank you for being available to take part in user testing today, which is Saturday, December 25, 2021

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,835
Zaki: First, introduce my name, Zakiyah Hamidah, a computer science student from Jakarta State University

4
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:39,012
Zaki: First - first I will explain about this fruitin application

5
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:45,373
Zaki: this fruitin application is an application that displays the nutritional value of various fruits

6
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:51,563
Zaki: This application will help users to find some nutritional content in fruits

7
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:59,213
Zaki: Then, first of all I will explain the user testing scenario today

8
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:05,858
Zaki: Later, after the introduction and also after this explanation

9
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:09,824
Zaki: I will ask some basic questions

10
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:16,425
Zaki: Then after that, there will be time for you to share your smartphone display screen

11
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:19,323
Zaki: and run the fruitin application

12
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:27,095
Zaki: Then after that, I will ask your opinion and ask some questions about the fruitin application

13
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:33,070
Zaki: So let's start today's user testing with basic questions

14
00:01:34,397 --> 00:01:38,570
Zaki: first of all, can you introduce yourself first?

15
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:48,663
Zaki: Starting from your name, age, occupation, domicile, play store email address, type of cellphone, android version of your cellphone?

16
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,983
Cindi: introduce my name is Cindi Tri Fitikasari

17
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,923
Cindi: I am currently a student at the State University of Jakarta majoring in Computer Science

18
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:07,677
Cindi: and domiciled in East Jakarta, Ciracas

19
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:11,462
Cindi: Then for the type of Android cellphone version 11

20
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:14,802
Zaki: The email address for the play store?

21
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:21,122
Cindi: Her email address is cindirifs@gmail.com

22
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,372
Zaki: Okay, let's move on to the next question

23
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,522
Zaki: Do you or your family like fruit?

24
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:34,618
Cindi: Yes, I happen to like fruit at home

25
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:38,671
Cindi: Maybe almost everyone likes fruit

26
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:45,111
Zaki: Then, what is the favorite fruit for Cindi and Cinda's family?

27
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:54,451
Cindi: maybe your favorite fruit is the one you often make at home, like oranges or melons

28
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,783
Cindi: And........

29
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:01,613
Cindi: Banana

30
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,290
Zaki: Okay

31
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,660
Zaki: Then, how often do cindi and cindi's family eat fruit every day?

32
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,337
Cindi: You could say quite often or every day

33
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:23,571
Zaki: Then, does Cindi often remind others to eat fruit?

34
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:28,653
Cindi: If that's not the case, because it depends on the individual itself

35
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:31,633
CIndi: So never remind others

36
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,649
Zaki: Then, does Cindi know the nutritional value of the fruits she consumes?

37
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:48,199
CIndi: As for the content of the fruit, maybe I only know the basics

38
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,708
Cindi: Like oranges contain vitamin C

39
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,706
Cindi: Don't know calories etc.

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,188
Cindi: I only know the basics that are usually mentioned

41
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,518
Cindi: I don't know much about it

42
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:03,438
Zaki: Okay

43
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,399
Zaki: The last question, Has cindi ever been or is she currently following a diet program?

44
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:14,165
Zaki: If yes, what food or fruit does Cindi consume while on a diet?

45
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:19,160
Cindi: I happen to have never been on a diet

46
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,543
Cindi: Never participated in the program either

47
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,753
Zaki: Okay, fine

48
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,300
Zaki: Okay, since the question is done

49
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,909
Zaki: time to share screen

50
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,024
Zaki: So, I'm giving you a chance to share screen

51
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,644
Zaki: and install the fruitin application from the play store

52
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,581
ZAki: Then, run it on your smartphone

53
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:50,134
Cindi: OK, does this share screen have to be installed or when you install the application?

54
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:53,124
Zaki: from scratch install it

55
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:18,160
Cindi: Have you performed yet?

56
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,790
Zaki: Already

57
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:57,697
Zaki: You can explore the app

58
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,710
Zaki: How are the features,...

59
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:05,680
Zaki: You can share your opinion, either criticism or suggestions about the application

60
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,558
Cindy: Okay

61
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:25,588
Cindi: This is not all the fruit, right?

62
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:30,358
Cindi: I mean, there's something that doesn't exist like that

63
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:34,569
Zaki: Yes, the fruit list isn't complete yet

64
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,745
Zaki: There's only what's written on the app

65
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:48,645
Cindi: this is clicked

66
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,855
Zaki: Yes you can

67
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,858
Cindi: If you go to bookmarks, it doesn't exist, right?

68
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:32,489
Zaki: oh yeah maybe there is still a problem with the bookmarks feature

69
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:42,531
Cindy: Yes already

70
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,001
Cindi: I have tried

71
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:52,483
Zaki: since you've tried it, I'll ask you what you think about this fruitin app

72
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:09,596
Cindi: Maybe his opinion was that there were some fruits that weren't there yet

73
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:18,091
Cindi: but maybe later with the passage of time the list of fruits can be added

74
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,251
Cindi: For the appearance it's good

75
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:25,418
Cindi: simple

76
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:32,016
Cindi: immediately there is a list of pictures of the fruit and the name of the fruit

77
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:40,426
Cindi: here is the name of the family and the genus

78
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,082
Cindi: any info on carbohydrates and others

79
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:51,262
Cindi: Maybe for people who don't know.....

80
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:57,186
Cindi: how much does our body need for carbohydrates and protein

81
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,686
Cindi: Maybe the information needs to be added

82
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:07,576
Cindi: Because if it's just information like this it might be considered

83
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:12,219
Cindi: just for info

84
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:16,465
Zaki: Okay

85
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:22,830
Zaki: Then, in your opinion, which features have problems or problems with the application?

86
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:31,166
Cindi: The first one has a bookmarks feature, which is adding fruit to bookmarks

87
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,754
Cindi: It looks like there was a crash

88
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:41,116
Zaki: Maybe you can try again, because it looks like it's loading

89
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,016
Zaki: So it seems a bit slow to respond

90
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,216
Cindy: That's right

91
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:57,028
Cindi: Can you do this search or not?

92
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:05,850
Cindy: Not yet

93
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:09,270
Zaki: Yes, it seems that there are still problems with this search feature

94
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:28,769
Zaki: Then is the flow in this application easy to understand or is it still complicated?

95
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:38,833
Cindi: For the plot, because this is just to provide information about the nutritional fruits

96
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,453
Cindi: Pretty easy to understand

97
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,411
Zaki: Ok, thanks for the suggestion

98
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:02,947
Zaki: then for the view, you think it's good enough, right?

99
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:06,017
Cindi: Yes, it's good enough to see

100
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:07,817
CIndi: The colors match too

101
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,542
Zaki: Then, do you think this application is useful enough to use?

102
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:22,679
Cindi: Yes

103
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,619
Cindi: To display information is enough

104
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:30,539
Cindi: but maybe in the future more information can be added

105
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,565
Zaki: That's enough

106
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:45,195
Zaki: Can you give a rating or comment on the play store for this fruitin application?

107
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,862
Cindi: Now or how?

108
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:50,552
Zaki: Yes now

109
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:05,548
Cindy: Already

110
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:09,078
Zaki: Ok, thanks to cindi for the rating

111
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,592
Cindi: Can this stop share screen?

112
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:16,192
Zaki: Oh yes you can stop sharing the screen

113
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:24,522
Zaki: Okay

114
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:30,952
Zaki: Maybe I will summarize your opinion earlier

115
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:37,322
Zaki: Maybe you said earlier that the search and bookmarks features are still having problems

116
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:50,918
Zaki: Then, you also give suggestions to add information related to nutrition for our body

117
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:57,032
Zaki: and also suggest adding to the fruit list for more

118
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:58,922
Zaki: Is it true?

119
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,722
CIndi: That's right

120
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:15,041
Zaki: Thank you cindi for the criticism and suggestions on the fruitin application

121
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:17,851
Cindi: Iya sama - sama zakiyah

122
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,077
Zaki: Because today's user testing session is over

123
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:27,327
Zaki: I once again thank cindi for her availability

124
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:31,737
Zaki: more or less sorry, wassalamualaikum wr.wb

125
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:35,225
Cindi: Waalaikumsalam wr.wb

126
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:36,565
Zaki: Thank you cindi
